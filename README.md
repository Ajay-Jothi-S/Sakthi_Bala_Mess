# Sakthi_Bala_Mess
I'm creating a website for a food stall in Surandai named Sakthibala Mess. I've
added the ability to order food on that website. The users will be able to place an
online order for the foods at that specific stall.I used HTML, CSS, Bootstrap 5, and
JavaScript to create this website. The website is single-page application. It is also
responsive on both computers and mobile devices.
